# SJTU Discrete Mathematics Course - CS2501

## Course Overview

Welcome to the Discrete Mathematics course repository, which was taught at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) in 2022. This course  was designed to provide foundational knowledge in discrete mathematics, crucial for advanced studies in computer science. 

This repository contains various resources and lab exercises to enhance understanding of key concepts in discrete mathematics, including symbolic execution, SAT and SMT solvers.

## Topics Covered in the course

- **Symbolic Execution, SAT and SMT Solvers**: An exploration of symbolic execution techniques and the functioning of SAT and SMT solvers.
- **Propositional Logic, Predicate Logic, Hoare Logic**: A dive into different logic systems, their principles, and applications.
- **Set Theory**: Fundamental aspects of set theory.
- **Binary Relations**: The significance of binary relations in mathematics and computer science.
- **Turing Machines**: An introduction to Turing Machines and their role in the theoretical model of computation.

## Labs

This course includes a series of practical labs to reinforce the theoretical concepts.  My implementations for these labs can be found in the files named `labx.cpp`.

1. **SAT Solver using Python**: Building a SAT solver from scratch using Python.
2. **Symbolic Execution with MiniSEE**: Implementing symbolic execution techniques with MiniSEE.
3. **Program Verification with Dafny**: Real-world program verification exercises using Dafny.

## Resources

Included in this repository are additional resources and reading materials related to the course topics.
